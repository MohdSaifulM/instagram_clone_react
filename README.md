# Instagram clone part 2

Continue on with yesterday's Instagram clone by adding a new feature:

Allow users to add new instagram post to the page
- Suggested form inputs:
    - Username (e.g. `guru-schnecke`)
    - Image source (e.g. `https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/945/547/d04.jpg`)
    - Caption (e.g `i love css`)

Suggested ways to get started:
1. First create a state object in the main component, store the posts json object in the state.
2. Create the input forms and relevant functions for user to modify/add to the state object. 

## Further (Optional)
1. Allow user to "like" a post
2. Allow user to add comments to individual posts

## Further further (optional optional)
For additional practice with react, convert the expense tracker app into a react application.

## To submit the homework
- fork and clone the repo
- add your codes and submit a pull request
